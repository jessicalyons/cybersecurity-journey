# Linux Commands (Beginner Notes)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Why I‚Äôm Learning Linux

Almost everything in cybersecurity touches Linux at some point ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs hacking labs, servers, or running tools in Kali. At first it was intimidating, but now I see it as one of the most powerful tools I can learn. I‚Äôm keeping track of the commands I use so I don‚Äôt forget and can build muscle memory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful for Cyber Work

- `nmap`, `tcpdump`, `nc` ‚Üí tools I‚Äôll learn next
- `chmod +x script.sh` ‚Üí makes a script executable
- `./script.sh` ‚Üí runs the script in current directory

## üí≠ What Still Confuses Me

- File permission breakdown (what 777 or 644 mean exactly)
- How to use `grep` with `cat` or logs
