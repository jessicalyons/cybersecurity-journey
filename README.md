# My Cybersecurity Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub repo where I document everything I learn as I break into cybersecurity. I'm currently focused on networking, ethical hacking, and Linux basics. This is where Iâ€™ll share my notes, scripts, TryHackMe progress, and home lab setup. Feedback is always welcome!
